# GRANDstack Starter

This is an example of the [GRANDstack Starter](https://grandstack.io/docs/getting-started.html) project that uses `Neo4jGraphQLServer`.

## Modifying the Schema

There are a few changes to [the schema](https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-starter/blob/master/api/src/graphql-schema.js) worth noting:

* Each type receives a `@model` directive \(currently required by neo4j-graphql-binding to support various features\).   
* Some fields also receive a `@unique` directive and for every model type without an `id: ID! @unique` field, one is generated and added.  
* The Cypher statement within the `@cypher` directive for the computed `avgStars` field on the User type is written within a block string to make it easier to work with. Until they become standard, block strings for `@cypher` directive statements are supported if you use `neo4jIDL` to update your Neo4j-GraphQL schema.

These changes result in the below modified `typeDefs`:

```graphql
type User @model {
  name: String! @unique
  friends: [User] @relation(name: "FRIENDS", direction: "OUT")
  reviews: [Review] @relation(name: "WROTE", direction: "OUT")
  avgStars: Float @cypher(statement: """
    MATCH (this)-[:WROTE]->(r:Review)
    RETURN toFloat(avg(r.stars))
  """)
}

type Business @model {
  name: String! @unique
  address: String
  city: String
  state: String
  reviews: [Review] @relation(name: "REVIEWS", direction: "IN")
  categories: [Category] @relation(name: "IN_CATEGORY", direction: "OUT")
}

type Review @model {
  stars: Int
  text: String
  business: Business @relation(name: "REVIEWS", direction: "OUT")
  user: User @relation(name: "WROTE", direction: "IN")
}

type Category @model {
  name: ID! @unique
  businesses: [Business] @relation(name: "IN_CATEGORY", direction: "IN")
}
```

## Seeding the Database

![Batch mutation and generated API in GraphQL Playground](.gitbook/assets/dbseedplayground.png)

Using these `typeDefs` and generated nested `create` and `connect` mutations, we can now run a modified version of [the batch mutation](https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-starter/blob/master/api/src/seed/seed-mutations.js) used to seed the database:

```graphql
